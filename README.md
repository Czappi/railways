Flutter State-management library (A superset of Bloc)

## Why yet another state-management library
I don't want to reinvent the wheel, but I was always dissatisfied with how Bloc handles errors (basically have to have it as part of the state). 
So I'm going to create my really opinionated library built upon Bloc which handles errors outside of the state.
